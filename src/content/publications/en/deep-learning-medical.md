## Introduction
Deep learning has revolutionized the field of medical image analysis in recent years. This paper explores the latest advancements and applications of these techniques in healthcare settings.

## Methods
We surveyed over 200 peer-reviewed articles published between 2018-2024, analyzing the performance of various neural network architectures including CNNs, U-Net variants, and transformer-based models for medical imaging tasks.

## Results
Our analysis reveals significant improvements in diagnostic accuracy, particularly in early disease detection and subtle abnormality identification. We found that ensemble methods combining multiple architectures often yield the best results across diverse imaging datasets.

## Discussion
Despite impressive advancements, challenges remain in interpretability, data scarcity for rare conditions, and generalization across different imaging protocols. We discuss potential solutions and future research directions to address these limitations.
